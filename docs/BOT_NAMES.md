# Bot Names

Bot names are loaded from the following config file: `addons/navbot/configs/bot_names.cfg`.    
You should rename that file to `bot_names.custom.cfg` before making modifications to it.

## Format

One name per line, maximum of 30 characters.    
You can add comments by starting the line with `//`.
