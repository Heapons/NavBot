# Updating an Existing NavBot Installation

To update an existing installation, extract the newer version and replace the existing files.    
The update patch notes may have additional instructions or information.    
You should **always** replace every file from the following folders:

* data
* extensions
* gamedata

Always replace files in `scripting` if you're using NavBot's Sourcepawn API.    
The `configs` folder can be skipped but recommended to also update. Most NavBot config files supports the `.custom` suffix to prevent updates from overwriting your custom configs.
