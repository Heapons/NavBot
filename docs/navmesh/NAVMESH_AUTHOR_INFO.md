# Authors and Editors

NavBot nav meshes stores information about who created and edited them. The name and SteamID64 are saved.

The command `sm_nav_list_editors` will print the author and editors to the console.

The first person to edit the nav mesh will be saved as the author, any other person who edit it will be saved as an editor.
