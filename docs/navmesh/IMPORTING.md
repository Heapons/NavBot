# Importing an Existing Navigation Mesh File

NavBot supports importing and converting official navigation mesh files into NavBot's format.  
To import a nav mesh, run this command: `sm_nav_import`.    
Note: Importing can only be done when no nav mesh is present.    

After importing, run `sm_nav_analyze` with quick save disabled.
