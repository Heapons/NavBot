# `sm_nav_slope_limit` and Stairs

On some stairs that level designers did not add an invisible slope to smooth player movement, the navigation mesh generation sometimes partially skips the stairs or doesn't fully connect it.

Using `sm_nav_slope_limit 0.48` generally improves the mesh generation on these stairs.

This hint is not exclusive to NavBot and helps a lot when making nav meshes for Garry's mod since a lot of level designers never heard of stair clipping.
