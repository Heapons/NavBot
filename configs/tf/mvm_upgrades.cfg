	 *			"quality" "2" -- can be omitted, 2 is the default quality. Omit this unless it's also specified in the game's upgrade script file
	 *
	 *			priority, bots will buy upgrades with the lowest priority first.
	 *			in case two or more upgrades have the same priority, they will be selected randomly
	 *			priority must start at 1, bot thinks they finished their upgrades when no upgrades are found for a given priority
	 * 			"priority" "1"
	 *			"slot" "0" -- weapon slot used by this upgrade, 
	 *          -1 for player upgrades, 9 for canteen power up bottle
